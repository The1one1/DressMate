# DressMate

Fashion is a significant aspect of people's lives, and with the rise of e-commerce, customers have access to numerous clothing options. However, the sheer volume of products available online can be overwhelming, making it difficult for customers to find their ideal outfits. Our project proposes a personalized clothing recommendation system that uses ResNet50 and Pinecone to process images from the Amazon Women Top Fashion dataset and generate accurate recommendations for the user. Unlike conventional systems, which rely on the user's purchase history, our system allows users to input an image of a product they are interested in to generate recommendations based on similar visual features. The inclusion of a virtual try-on feature, powered by HrViton and Flask API, also increases user confidence in their purchasing decisions.

## Introduction

In the era of e-commerce, fashion industry is witnessing a significant shift in the way customers shop. However, with a plethora of options available on online fashion platforms, customers often face difficulties in identifying their preferred outfit. Therefore, in this project, we propose a personalized clothing recommendation system that utilizes neural networks to process product images from the Amazon Women's Fashion dataset and generate recommendations based on visual similarities. Additionally, we integrate a virtual try-on feature to enhance user confidence in purchasing decisions.

##  Proposed methodology

In this project, we have developed a personalized Clothing Recommendation System that includes a Virtual Try-On feature. Our system uses a ResNet50 model for feature extraction and Pinecone for vector searches to quickly and accurately recommend similar clothing items based on their visual features. We have also integrated the HrViton model with our Flask API to provide users with a virtual try-on experience. Our system analyzes product titles and descriptions for matching patterns and recommends products based on user preferences.

## Training the neural networks

Once the data is pre-processed, the neural networks are trained using transfer learning from ResNet50. Additional layers are added to the last few layers of the network to fine-tune the model to the current task of virtual try-on. The ResNet50 architecture, shown in the figure, serves as a strong base for the model's feature extraction capabilities.

To optimize the performance of the network, we experimented with different hyperparameters and loss functions. We used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002, and trained the network for 100 epochs. We also used a combination of L1 and adversarial loss functions to ensure that the generated images were both realistic and accurately represented the target clothing item. Additionally, we implemented a perceptual loss function, which helped to preserve important features in the input image while also ensuring that the generated output was visually pleasing.

Through this approach, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the high-resolution HR-VITON dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for image-based virtual try-on. Our optimized network architecture and training methodology can be applied to a variety of virtual try-on applications, enabling more accurate and realistic clothing simulations.

## Getting the inventory

The images from Amazon women fashion Dataset. The 
inventory is then run through the neural networks to classify and generate embeddings and the output 
is then used to generate recommendations. The Figure shows a sample set of inventory data

## Conclusion

In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, 
visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. 
The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features 
of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random 
fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image 
based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward 
to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion 
exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
